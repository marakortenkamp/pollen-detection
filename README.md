We will use this repository to work on our project collaboratively. This document is supposed to be used as a documentation of our project and will be updated regularly.

## 1. Data
* We did the data labeling together with group 1 and used supervisely to label the pollen baskets in the videos.
* Every second frame of the videos was uploaded to supervisely and then the every pollen baskets was marked with a single point. 
* https://app.supervise.ly/projects/76211/datasets

## 2. Environment
* We decided to write our code in a jupyter notebook: bee-proyject.ipynb. We will use python and especially the pytorch library.  
(We actively decided not to use google colab, since we haven't had a good experiences using it for larger projects.)
